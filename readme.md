# 🏳️ Flag Project!! 🏳️‍🌈

## What is it?🎌
This project is something I did on the first Brazilian Lockdown after seeing an YouTube Video (I'll find and credit it).  
So, the idea is pretty simple, get the Brazilian Embassy page, crawl through it and collect every email and the respective embassy.  
After that, setup a message and send email to each one asking for a Flag or any kind of souvenier.

## What is done? ☑️
So the crawling part is done ☑️  
REGEX to match emabassies names and emails ☑️  
Filtering doubles ☑️  
Removing noise that the REGEX match uncorrectly ☑️
Setting up email ☑️  
Sending email ☑️  
Loop through all names and emails ☑️  

## What still needs to be done?
Match country names to language codes  
Translating (sort of, almost done) body to country's language  
Modularizing the code to make easier to adapt  
Clean the unecessary parts

## What I hope to achieve? 
Well, I hope that I receive more responses than last time (only Sweden embassy sent me a flag (Thanks to all folks at the Swedish Embassy)), learn some more skills in the process and have fun along the way.  
If I receive anything, I will post below.
